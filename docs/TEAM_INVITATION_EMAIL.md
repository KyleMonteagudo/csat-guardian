# CSAT Guardian - Team Invitation Email

**Subject:** 🚀 Help GSX Make History at the CXP ACES AI Bash Hackathon - Join CSAT Guardian!

---

**Hi Team,**

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on for the **CXP ACES AI Bash Hackathon** and invite you to be part of something I believe can showcase the innovative spirit of GSX to our new leadership.

## The Project: CSAT Guardian

**CSAT Guardian** is an AI-powered Customer Satisfaction Risk Detection and Proactive Coaching platform designed specifically for Government Support Engineers (GSX). The goal is simple but impactful: **help our engineers deliver exceptional customer experiences by detecting satisfaction risks before they become problems.**

### What It Does

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🎯 Proactive Risk Detection** | AI analyzes case timelines to identify negative sentiment patterns before CSAT surveys are sent |
| **💬 AI-Powered Coaching** | Engineers receive personalized, context-aware recommendations for improving customer interactions |
| **📊 Real-Time Dashboards** | Visual analytics showing case health, sentiment trends, and 7-day compliance metrics |
| **🤖 Conversational AI Assistant** | Chat-based interface where engineers can ask case-specific questions and get actionable guidance |
| **📈 Team Performance Insights** | Manager views for identifying coaching opportunities and celebrating wins |

### Why This Matters

Every day, our engineers work tirelessly to support government customers. But often, by the time we receive CSAT feedback, it's too late to course-correct. CSAT Guardian flips that model:

> **"Shift from reactive CSAT recovery to proactive customer experience management."**

Instead of learning about a dissatisfied customer after the fact, CSAT Guardian helps engineers:
- Recognize early warning signs in customer communications
- Understand *why* sentiment might be declining
- Take action with specific, AI-generated coaching recommendations
- Turn potential detractors into promoters

### The Technology

This isn't just a concept—it's a **fully functional application** deployed in Azure Commercial:

- **Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o)** for intelligent sentiment analysis and coaching
- **Semantic Kernel Agents** with custom CSAT rules plugins
- **Azure SQL Database** for secure case data storage
- **Private Networking** with VNet integration and private endpoints
- **Managed Identity** authentication (no API keys or passwords)
- **Modern Glassmorphism UI** with Microsoft Learn-style design
